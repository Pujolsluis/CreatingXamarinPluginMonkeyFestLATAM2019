# Creating Xamarin Plugins
 Recently I had the opportunity to have fun with the attendees in my workshop "Creating Xamarin Plugins" where we got to see how we can easily create a Xamarin Plugin, based on the great multi targetting project template for Xamarin created by our good old friend [James Montemagno](https://montemagno.com/), Once the attendees saw all the parts of the template and how to configure the project correctly, it was time to publish and make our work available to the community with another great tool created by [Oren Novotny](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/nuget-package-explorer/9wzdncrdmdm3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) the 'Nuget Package Explorer" which all of the attendees loved because of how easy it made it for us to preview, modify and publish our plugins directly to the Nuget Gallery and have them available within minutes.
